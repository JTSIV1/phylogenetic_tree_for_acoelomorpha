# Generating a Phylogenetic Tree for Acoelomorpha

### Running the Code

All of the code for our assignment runs in `generating_tree.ipynb`. The steps taken and run on the code are specified in sequence in the notebook. The code will create some files when unzipping the data and also populates the text files `included_species.txt`, `species_count.txt`, and `species_group.txt`. In order to run, the protein scoring matrices must be present (`BLOSUM45.txt`, `BLOSUM62.txt`, and `PAM250.txt`)
